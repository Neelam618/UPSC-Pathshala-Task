# Known issues
- The custom select input is not keyboard accessible

# Local setup
> This project uses Sass to manage styles.
> All the source styles are inside `scss` folder
> Final css is generated in the `css` folder

- Run `npm install` once to install `node-sass`
- Run `npm run sass` before making any changes in the `scss` folder
(Keep this running in the terminal so that any changes you make in the scss files are automatically converted to css, and minified)
